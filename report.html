                &emsp;&emsp;As a team, we feel our idea has a solid base with good intentions of 
                helping the freshman students at UF. Following the UCD process gave us confidence in 
                our idea and that it would benefit users in the way we were intending. Peers though 
                that we had a desirable idea and product which freshman (and themselves) would use. 
                Our prototype had some criticism as some felt it didn’t go in depth on the features 
                of our app, but the response was that our application had potential and room for growth.

                &emsp; &emsp; It came to our attention that the application wouldn’t be able to compete with google maps and doesn’t 
                have a longer use case since once students know where their classes are as they will simple stop using 
                the product. To address the first point, this product isn’t meant to compete with google maps, it is an 
                edge case which we are creating an application to fill. Google maps does provide the location of a class’s 
                building, however there are a few flaws which out application addresses: the bus route system and the 
                location of the classroom within the building. The UF bus routes are not properly displayed on google 
                maps, it has bus times listed to arrive around 10–15 minutes every stop which isn’t the case. 
                Our application would work with the current RTS Tracking App system to give proper times for bus 
                arrivals and departures to give students a more accurate times for them to get to their classes. Our other 
                main feature will show the location of the classroom within the building. We have received a criticism 
                that most people will be able to find their classroom once the building can be found, which is true. 
                However, our focus is convenience, students will not have to wander around the halls to find the classroom 
                or figure out the numbering convention when it comes to where the rooms are laid out in the halls. 
                In addition, there are some buildings which have layouts that are not easy to navigate, the CISE building 
                is one of them with two floors of rooms having sequential numbering PLUS classroom that are not 
                accessible without entering another room first. To a first time student, this can be confusing. To address 
                the second point, our application is mean to have this specific use case. Once students know where their 
                classes are then they may not have use for the application however there will always be more freshman to 
                UF AND there will always be more semesters for students where they will need to know where their classes 
                are. There is a steady supply of users, and our application will have peaks in its use. This design was 
                intentional and meant to be an educational tool, in a sense, to help students get used to their campus. 
                This application will cut down on the time it takes to search for classrooms and allow students experience 
                less stress when navigating the expansive UF campus.

                    &emsp;Our plan from here on is to develop our main features even further than we have currently. 
                    Through the development of our prototype, we can further demonstrate our mapping application and 
                    test them through the use of created personas and through user testing to explore the needs of the
                     user and tune our application to them.

                    &emsp;Our focus will be on prototyping and testing the features we deemed to be essential to the 
                    functionality of our application. Our high-fidelity prototype will be based on the features 
                    showcased on our poster and will be created using InVision. We will accompany the prototype
                     with a demonstrational video which can be posted to this website to showcase the progress 
                     towards the final product of our application.

                    &emsp;We plan to demonstrate our prototype through user-based testing as well as creating 
                    personas to help us develop and understand the use cases of our idea. Through the feedback 
                    we receive, we plan to tune our application to provide the essential functionality combined 
                    with accessibility to give the best experience to our users.
