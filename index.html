            <h1>Our Goal:</h1>
            <div class="text-box-m">
                We have met with several UF freshman about what they felt they needed the most to help them succeed in
                starting their college careers and found a need for an easily accessible campus map. Our goal is to
                provide the ability to access the UF campus map with accessibility along
                with some quality of life features. Students will have the ability to search the map by course number to
                find the building and floor that their classroom is located. Then, using
                google maps or other GPS software, be able to find directions to their class with ease.

            <h1>Our Justification:</h1>
            <div class="text-box-m">
                We have found, after interviewing several incoming freshman as well as some senior students, that
                students at UF have a unmet need to be able to easily locate their classes.
                Incoming students often are met with a loss when it comes to traversing their new campus, with many
                students noting how UF's campus is several times larger than what they are used to.
                With this information, we are hoping to fill this unfilled need by creating a platform which students
                will have easy access to locate their classes without any extra hassle.

                We hope to help the UF freshman population, visitors to UF, and older students to traverse campus at
                their ease.
