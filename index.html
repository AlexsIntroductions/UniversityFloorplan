                <div class="text-box-desc">
                    &emsp;We interviewed several freshmen at UF to find out what they want to
                    help them succeed during their first year at UF. The majority of them answered
                    that they needed help figuring out where their classes were and how to get to
                    them. A few mentioned that UF is much bigger than the high school they were
                    used to and would like an easier way to find their classes than google maps,
                    which wouldnâ€™t tell them where the classroom is, just the building.

                <div class="text-box-desc">
                    &emsp;We took this problem and brainstormed an application which would help
                    students at UF find their classes which we named the University Floorplan.
                    The goal of our application is providing an accessible map of UF campus which
                    students will be able to use to find directions directly to their desired
                    classroom. We created our presentational poster showcasing the features we
                    hope to have in the final product.

                <div class="text-box-desc">
                    &emsp;After defining our idea along with the features we hope to provide, we
                    created our poster and personas which showed our progress towards our final
                    product. The poster was to gather feedback from peers as well as to see what
                    other users bases we could find for this application. Through our poster,
                    our interviews with various freshmen, and the development of our personas
                    we were able to find our focuses to help us better understand our user base
                    and use this to refine our application to our goal of ease of use and accessibility.

            <h1>Our Justification:</h1>
            <div class="text-box-m">
                We have found, after interviewing several incoming freshman as well as some senior students, that
                students at UF have a unmet need to be able to easily locate their classes.
                Incoming students often are met with a loss when it comes to traversing their new campus, with many
                students noting how UF's campus is several times larger than what they are used to.
                With this information, we are hoping to fill this unfilled need by creating a platform which students
                will have easy access to locate their classes without any extra hassle.

                We hope to help the UF freshman population, visitors to UF, and older students to traverse campus at
                their ease.

                        &emsp;I am a 4th year in Computer Science, with a minor in 
                        Biomechanics. I spend much of my time working on 
                        improvements for code and trying to better myself in the 
                        field. This project speaks to me since when I was a freshman, 
                        and even still, during the first few weeks of classes I find 
                        myself in a world of confusion looking for classes. I have s
                        pent upwards of 15 minutes looking for a room in a building
                         before, and it honestly never gets better. Because of this
                          I have been excitedly working towards this application.

                        interviews into user personas. I wrote out user 
                        stories and details that pertain to our target 
                        users.I also focused on the brainstorming section 
                        and was a part of the process for feature selection. 
                        I contributed with more emphasis to both the exploration 
                        and generation process. Finally, I compiled all of our 
                        exploration and generation process into one presentation.
